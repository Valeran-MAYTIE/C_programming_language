# Chapter 1 exercises

## Exercice 1.1
 
    Run the "hello, world" program

## Exercie 1.2

    Experiment to find out what happens when printf's 
    argument strinf contains \c

## Exercice 1.3

    Modify the temperature conversion program to
    print heading above the table

## Exercice 1.4

    Write a program to print 
    the corresponding Celsius to Fahrenheit

## Exercice 1.5

    Modify the temperature conversion program to
    print the table in reverse order, that is, from 300 degrees to 0.

## Exercice 1.6

    Verify that the expression getchar() != EOF is 0 or 1

## Exercice 1.7

    Write a program to print a value of EOF

## Exercice 1.8

    Write a program to count blanks, tabs, and newlines.

## Exercice 1.9

    Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each
    string of one or more balks by a single blank

## Exercice 1.10

    Write a program to copy its input to its output replacing
    each tab by \t, each backspace by \b, and each backslash by \\.
    This makes tabs and backspaces visisbla in an unambiguous way.

## Exercice 1.11 

    How would you test the word count program ? What kinds of input 
    most likely to uncover bugs if there are any ?

## Exercice 1.12

    Write a program that prints its input one word per line

## Exercice 1.13

### a.
    
    Write a program to print a histogram of the lenghts of words
    in its input. It is easy to draw the histogram with the bars horizontal.

### b.

    write the same program as the a. but with a veritcal historgram.

# Exercice 1.14

    Write a program to print a histogram of the frequencies  of
    different character in its input.

# Exercice 1.15

    Rewrite the temperature converion porgram to use
    dunction for conversion

# Exercice 1.16

    Revise the main routine of the longest-line program so it will
    correctly print the length of arbitarily long input lines, and as
    much as possible of the text.

# Exercice 1.17

    Write a program to print all input lines that are longer than 80
    characters.

# Exercice 1.18

    Write a program to remove trailing blanks and tabs from each
    line of input, and to delete entirely blank lines

# Exercice 1.19

    Write a function reverse(s) that reverses the charater string s.
    Use it to write a program that reverses its input a line at time.

# Exercice 1.20

    Write a program `detab` that replaces tabs in the input with the
    proper number of blanks to space to the next tab stop. Assume a fixed
    set of tab stops, say every n columns. Should n be a variable or a
    symbolic parameter?

# Exercice 1.21

    Write a program entab that replaces strings of blanks by the 
    minimum number of tabs and blacks to achieve the same spacing. Use the
    same tab stops as for detab. When either a tab or a single blank would
    suffice to reac a tab stops

# Exercice 1.22

    Write a program to "fold" long input lines into two or more
    shorter lines after the last non-blank character that occurs before
    the n-th colomn of input. Make sure your program does 
    something intelligent withe very long lines, and if ther
    are no blanks or tabs before the specifier column.

# Exercice 1.23

    Write a program to remove all comments from a C program.
    Don't forget to handle quoted strings and character constants 
    properly. C comments do not nest.

# Exercice 1.24

    Write a program to check a C program for rudimentary syntax
    errors like unbalances parentheses, brackets and braces. Don't forget 
    about quotes, both single and double, escape sequences, and 
    comments. (This porgram is hard if you do it in full generality);
